# REPO/d

Repo/d is a Ruby on Rails application which allows students to search, browse, and link to tech resources that enhance their learning experience.  Teachers post recommended resources for  students which relate to course content, and students are able to suggest resources which must be approved by a teacher before they appear in the student view.
